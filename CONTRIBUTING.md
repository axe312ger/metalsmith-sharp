## Commit conventions

To keep the automated release and changelog engine running, every commit should follow the [conventional changelog standard](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md) introduced by angular.

Use [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) to ease up creating commit messages with the conventional changelog standard. It is fully integrated into the project.
